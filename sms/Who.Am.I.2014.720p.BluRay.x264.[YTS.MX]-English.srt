1
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,800
<i>If I had known how everything
was going to happen.</i>

2
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,481
<i>I would have done everything differently.</i>

3
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,721
<i>I would have stayed invisible.</i>

4
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,441
<i>A nobody.</i>

5
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,962
<i>But I'm no longer a nobody.</i>

6
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,681
<i>I'm one of the most wanted
hackers in the word.</i>

7
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,561
<i>Who am I?</i>

8
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,081
<i>I am Benjamin.</i>

9
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:29,401
<i>And this is my story.</i>

10
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:06,161
He's learned his lesson.

11
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,161
He claims he's done with hacking.

12
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,002
He said he can lead us to
Friends and Russian cyber mafia

13
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,801
He wants to talk only to you.

14
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,281
And you are... who am I?

15
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:26,361
There's a reason why you're here.

16
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,681
A reason I'm here for.

17
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,401
So?

18
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:34,921
<i>Everything is somehow connected.</i>

19
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,121
<i>Everything that has a beginning has an end.</i>

20
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,561
<i>It's a mix of everything.</i>

21
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,401
<i>And I'm in the middle.</i>

22
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:50,240
<i>I always wanted to be a superhero</i>

23
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,561
<i>with a superpower.</i>

24
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,321
<i>I wanted to do things that
nobody thought possible.</i>

25
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:58,000
<i>In reality I already had a superpower.</i>

26
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,161
<i>I was invisible.</i>

27
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:01,960
<i>And I also had a superhero costume.</i>

28
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,001
Paradise Pizza: The end of the rainbow.

29
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,201
<i>Every superhero needs a
tragic family story:</i>

30
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:08,880
<i>Spiderman's parents.</i>

31
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,121
Dead.

32
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,601
<i>Batman's parents.</i>

33
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:13,241
<i>Killed.</i>

34
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,361
<i>Superman's parents.</i>

35
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:15,881
<i>Exploded.</i>

36
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:18,001
<i>I actually had the best requirements.</i>

37
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,121
<i>My dad ran away to France when I was born.</i>

38
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:23,881
<i>I've never met him.</i>

39
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,401
<i>A similarity that I share with my grandma.</i>

40
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,361
<i>Her father died in the Second World War.</i>

41
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:32,921
<i>The only memory she has from him</i>

42
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:37,521
<i>are three bullet casings his comrade
brought from foreign countries.</i>

43
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:47,721
<i>My mom took her own life when I was 8.</i>

44
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,401
<i>The best material for a hero story.</i>

45
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,601
<i>My grandma took care of me</i>

46
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,161
<i>and later I took care of her.</i>

47
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,521
I'm not a psychologist.

48
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:02,041
I don't care about your dreams.

49
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:04,280
What do you know about CLAY?

50
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,721
About your alliance with the Fr13nds?

51
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:10,681
Everything you want to know.

52
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:19,521
<i>But every detail is important.</i>

53
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,201
<i>Hacking is like magic.</i>

54
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,161
<i>They're both about deceiving the others.</i>

55
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:36,241
<i>Since I was 14 I spent my
time in front of the PC.</i>

56
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:38,281
<i>I learned programming languages.</i>

57
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,001
<i>Hacked my first system.</i>

58
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,241
<i>A universe of infinite possibilities.</i>

59
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,560
<i>For the first time I felt
like I was good at something.</i>

60
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,001
<i>In real life I was a zero among ones.</i>

61
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,201
<i>An outsider.</i>

62
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:52,241
<i>A loser.</i>

63
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,321
<i>A freak.</i>

64
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,761
<i>But on the Internet I felt
a sense of belonging.</i>

65
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,121
<i>A refuge for people like me.</i>

66
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:07,920
<i>Everyone who wasted their
time on the World-Wide-Web</i>

67
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:10,160
<i>met here in the so-called "darknet".</i>

68
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:12,001
<i>The Internet within the Internet.</i>

69
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:14,401
<i>Here I could be whoever I wanted.</i>

70
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,801
<i>I spent days and nights on the PC.</i>

71
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,681
<i>Then I slept in the real world.</i>

72
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,881
<i>But there was an antidote</i>

73
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,441
I got the idea from my biggest idol.

74
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,600
<i>There are a lot of great hackers out there.</i>

75
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:31,961
<i>There was only one true hero for me.</i>

76
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,241
<i>He called himself "MRX".</i>

77
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:36,321
<i>He is from nowhere.</i>

78
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:38,201
<i>No one knew who he was.</i>

79
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,040
<i>He could hack into any system.</i>

80
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,161
<i>He was a real star.</i>

81
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:45,121
<i>One of his most famous hacks
was a social network attack.</i>

82
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,801
<i>He didn't take anything
or anyone seriously.</i>

83
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,201
<i>He was the superhero among all hackers.</i>

84
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:52,881
<i>I wanted to be like him.</i>

85
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:56,241
<i>He had an exploit used to
manipulate an online pharmacy</i>

86
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:57,521
<i>to get Ritalin.</i>

87
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,201
<i>The hacker's watchman.</i>

88
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:02,561
MRX had 3 rules:

89
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:11,281
3rd: Have fun in cyberspace and meatspace.

90
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:15,721
In other words, don't limit your fun, don't
enjoy things only in the virtual world.

91
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,481
<i>But the real reason I sit here now</i>

92
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:20,480
<i>why everything happened this way</i>

93
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,481
<i>is Marie.</i>

94
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:25,201
Hey! Just resting hasn't
helped anyone so far.

95
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:29,161
Hope is the rainbow over
the waterfall of our life.

96
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,281
Do you still want to pass the exam?

97
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,720
Try with learning!

98
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:36,321
Or do you hope someone will steal
the exam questions for you?

99
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:38,881
I called Superman but he had no time.

100
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,041
Retard!

101
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,600
What kind of weirdo bird are you?

102
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:47,601
Paradise Pizza.

103
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,441
The end of the rain-...

104
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:49,641
- bow.

105
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:54,041
<i>During the school time I was
desperately in love with Marie.</i>

106
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:58,921
<i>But after ten years no one still
remembers the freak from the last row.</i>

107
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,881
That'll be 34.28

108
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:13,200
I said without anchovy

109
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:13,241
I'm not paying for this!
I said without anchovy

110
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:14,601
I'm not paying for this!

111
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:16,441
Don't be an ass, Oscar!

112
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:18,121
The rest is for you.

113
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:19,681
What? Are you crazy?

114
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,480
Mr. Anchovy gives you a hundred
more if you get the exam questions.

115
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:24,561
Bachelor of Laws.

116
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:29,081
The world doesn't need a savior

117
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,161
but everyday I hear people crying for one.

118
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,121
What?

119
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,841
That's Superman.

120
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:42,801
It's okay.

121
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,001
Thanks.

122
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,041
You're such a jerk!

123
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,081
<i>I finally wanted to be a superhero.</i>

124
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,721
<i>Marie had a problem</i>

125
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,241
<i>and I could solve it.</i>

126
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,281
<i>I just had to get her the exam questions.</i>

127
00:07:58,641 --> 00:07:59,641
<i>She'll remember me.</i>

128
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:00,561
<i>We'll fall in love</i>

129
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:01,560
<i>get married</i>

130
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:02,561
<i>have kids</i>

131
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:03,161
<i>be happy together.</i>

132
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:04,361
<i>Bingo.</i>

133
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:15,601
<i>The bachelor exam questions were stored on
the central server of the university.</i>

134
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,281
<i>All I needed was access.</i>

135
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:20,521
<i>It was way too easy.</i>

136
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,721
<i>Most of the hackers only pass through.</i>

137
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:29,121
<i>They appear in the system
without changing a thing.</i>

138
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,681
<i>Others leave a hint</i>

139
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,721
<i>and many take a souvenir.</i>

140
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:44,161
<i>I was Superman, Spiderman, Batman.</i>

141
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,481
What are you doing there?

142
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:48,681
<i>I was an idiot.</i>

143
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,561
No entries, no previous conviction

144
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,280
50 hours of community service.

145
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,402
Do something with your life!

146
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:58,641
It's up to you!

147
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:12,841
<i>My 50 hours of community service meant
cleaning a city I didn't care about.</i>

148
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,361
<i>It couldn't be any worse.</i>

149
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,681
<i>Not even the ritalin worked anymore.</i>

150
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:27,041
<i>But everything had to
change in one fell swoop.</i>

151
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:42,081
And? Why are you here?

152
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,641
Can't you speak or what?

153
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:51,921
Then no.

154
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:55,641
Let me guess...

155
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,440
you're one of those guys who
thinks life's unfair for them

156
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:00,441
who feels like only passing by

157
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:01,480
invisible

158
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,602
just as the rest of society.

159
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,240
In school you weren't even beaten up

160
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:05,721
because nobody gave a damn about you.

161
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:07,801
That's all really really sad.

162
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,721
Do you know what I think?

163
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,601
It's all just a scam.

164
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:17,361
Computer stuff.

165
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,561
And you?

166
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:28,641
This and that.

167
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:32,040
What kind of things? Huh?

168
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,041
DDoS attacks?

169
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,121
Botnets?

170
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,281
Phishing?

171
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,121
Or are you just a script kiddie?

172
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:41,121
I hacked the University's server.

173
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,602
How did you manage to gain access?

174
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,801
Using a 0Day Exploit.

175
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:47,401
You know how to read machine language?

176
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,521
Simply as that?

177
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,001
Mhm

178
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:55,561
I am Max.

179
00:10:58,081 --> 00:10:59,081
Benjamin.

180
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,561
Any plans for today?

181
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:07,360
<i>I keep wondering if there's a moment
that pulls all strings together.</i>

182
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:10,041
<i>That moment which changes everything.</i>

183
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,281
The later the evening gets, the
more drunk the guests become.

184
00:11:58,361 --> 00:11:59,682
How do you like my modest temple?

185
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:11,880
I don't even know half of these people.

186
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:13,001
All shit suckers!

187
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:16,321
<i>Max was the total opposite of me.</i>

188
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,361
Self-confident, charismatic.

189
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:20,561
A winner.

190
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,281
Close the door!

191
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:32,880
Let me introduce you.

192
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:33,881
This is Benjamin.

193
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,001
Stefan

194
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:46,001
Benjamin

195
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:47,441
Benjamin Engel.

196
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,921
<i>Stefan was the software master.</i>

197
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:52,160
<i>He could find a bug in any application.</i>

198
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:53,561
<i>He's always been completely insane.</i>

199
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:55,600
<i>He loved the thrill</i>

200
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,520
craziness

201
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:57,521
and so on.

202
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,281
No last name.

203
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,201
<i>Paul was the hardware freak.</i>

204
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:07,161
<i>Give him a paper clip and a motherboard
and he'll build anything you want.</i>

205
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:08,602
<i>Like me, he lost his mother early.</i>

206
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,400
<i>His rich father left him at an orphanage</i>

207
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,081
<i>so he could focus on the important things.</i>

208
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:17,161
Don't worry! His smile muscles
were removed at birth.

209
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:19,041
Max said that you can
read machine language.

210
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:20,761
Machine language?

211
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,841
Anyone can say that!

212
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,761
It's not something that's easy to prove!

213
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,801
Prove it!

214
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,321
Or you won't leave alive.

215
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,601
Angel

216
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:12,921
Paul

217
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,001
Benjamin.

218
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:16,601
Just Benjamin.

219
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:18,361
The fun begins now!

220
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:27,641
Don't worry!

221
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,361
We're not the swindlers.

222
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,521
What? Did you think that I live here?

223
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,041
Come on!

224
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:45,921
Come on! Go!

225
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:53,281
Make way!

226
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:59,561
You're the pizza bird!

227
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:02,321
Do you know each other?

228
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,321
It's his party!

229
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:11,641
What the fuck?

230
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,241
No last name.

231
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,641
I always stopped at warnings

232
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:41,761
never asked myself again after that

233
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,321
I can't anymore

234
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,801
I can't go any further.

235
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,601
See ya after!

236
00:15:58,201 --> 00:15:59,481
Now I remember you!

237
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:01,841
Benjamin! Benjamin Engel!

238
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,401
Our teacher forgot about you

239
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,961
and then you had to take
the train back home!

240
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,681
It was interesting...

241
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,241
the evening.

242
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,201
Bye!

243
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:23,961
Bye.

244
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:24,081
We all knew that this day will come.

245
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:27,281
Your grandma needs professional help.

246
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,201
You must let go!

247
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,481
She's on really good hands.

248
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:44,921
<i>My grandma was diagnosticated
with Al zheimer 4 years ago.

249
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,561
<i>Since then it's like an invisible
eraser deletes her borders.</i>

250
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:13,601
Tickets, please!

251
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:17,721
I thought the cops have caught you!

252
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:24,641
It wasn't a good idea in the very
first week to close the exit.

253
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:31,761
What's wrong?

254
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:42,641
You'll feel better.

255
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:45,201
Come on! I show you something!

256
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:48,201
Come on!

257
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:50,241
<i>I should have stayed there sitting.</i>

258
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:52,281
<i>But it was like between
us was an invisible rope.</i>

259
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,800
<i>He told me how he started with hacking.</i>

260
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:57,801
<i>I was all ears.</i>

261
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:01,721
There are people out there,
they think they're safe.

262
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:04,560
They have no idea what's going on.

263
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,922
Security. Everyone wants security.

264
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:08,041
Security doesn't exist!

265
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:10,841
Once you understand this, you know

266
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:15,001
it's like you have the
world served on a plate.

267
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:16,481
You only have to get it!

268
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:18,882
<i>Even though we were so different,
we had something in common.</i>

269
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:22,280
First: Don't enjoy your actions
only in the virtual world.

270
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:23,481
Second: Aim for the impossible

271
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,241
3rd: No system is safe.

272
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,161
MRX!

273
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,560
Never hide behind your computer.

274
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:32,561
MRX already knows this.

275
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,241
The main vulnerability isn't
in applications or servers.

276
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,641
Man is the main security flaw.

277
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,841
You hack people?

278
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,041
Exactly.

279
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:44,241
The most effective of all hacking
methods, the great art of deceiving:

280
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:45,321
Social engineering.

281
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:51,281
Man is by default trusting and confiding.

282
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:53,760
Social engineering uses
these two components

283
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:55,041
so that you can get anything you want:

284
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:58,001
Passwords, secret information, login data.

285
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,241
Hungry?

286
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,321
Hold this!

287
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:29,241
How many chocodonuts do I get for this?

288
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,480
It's a new sales pitch? Huh?

289
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,481
Pay for 10, get 8!

290
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:37,121
For those with chocolate
it wasn't available.

291
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:39,081
What would I stand here for?

292
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:41,641
Who required this?

293
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:45,321
That blonde from there!

294
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,801
Come on! I'm hungry and got things to do!

295
00:20:58,281 --> 00:20:59,200
There you go!

296
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,201
Have a good evening!

297
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:04,881
All good!

298
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,041
You must be bold enough!

299
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,681
Then the world is at your feet.

300
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,121
Oh! Already late!

301
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:13,561
Are you ready?

302
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:15,041
Come on let's go.

303
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:16,121
But...

304
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,761
Where are we going?

305
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:42,921
Come on!

306
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:45,121
G o!

307
00:21:57,801 --> 00:21:59,281
Why did you bring him?

308
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:02,001
You don't know if we can trust him!

309
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,241
You already saw what he can.

310
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:13,801
You can drive.

311
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:19,281
Don't make a big deal out of this!
We'll bring it back!

312
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,641
Looking like this, you'll never get in!

313
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:42,921
Why does he come?

314
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,640
I thought I come with you!

315
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:46,440
What are you up to?

316
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:47,441
Not "you", "we"!

317
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:49,561
Come on! Get dressed!

318
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:50,881
Chop-chop!

319
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:52,521
This wasn't part of the plan!

320
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:58,241
Let's go!

321
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,001
Good luck!

322
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,162
Don't you come with us?

323
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:06,241
I'd rather not!

324
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,001
Let's go, my young boy!

325
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,440
<i>The identification card was a
small simple piece of paper.</i>

326
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:23,481
<i>Five minutes of Photoshop.</i>

327
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,321
<i>Two minutes for printing.</i>

328
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:26,401
<i>Any idiot could do that.</i>

329
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:28,801
Identity card?

330
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:34,641
Without despatch!

331
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,361
Fellow of the Danish Federation.

332
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:38,721
Without.

333
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,041
Without despatch.

334
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:42,041
One of the guest speakers!

335
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:44,041
Danish people's front!

336
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,921
What has this to do with hacking?

337
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:04,641
The presentation's laptop

338
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:06,401
must be connected to another wifi network.

339
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:10,161
This is your job!

340
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:13,441
Don't forget! Aim for the impossible!

341
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:18,881
Shit! Shit!

342
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,041
Which?

343
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:21,641
What other network?

344
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:29,040
I don't trust the small one!

345
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,721
You don't trust anyone not even yourself!

346
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,121
Listen! They're sick of this!

347
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:35,681
The Federal Intelligence
Service has people everywhere!

348
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,361
They're between us! OK?

349
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:40,481
They have this kid that never said a lie.

350
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:27,801
I'm invisible!

351
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,561
I'm invisible!

352
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:33,561
I'm invisible!

353
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:22,361
You assholes!

354
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,881
Time for a bit of blasphemy!

355
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:33,441
Dear fellows,

356
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,841
we're presenting you now our new wallspot!

357
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,801
A small flame that will
burn in german's hearts!

358
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,321
Quiet!

359
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:14,841
Cut! Cut!

360
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:25,961
The lamers are coming!

361
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,320
Stefan! The keys!

362
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:29,321
I don't have them!

363
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:57,761
<i>That was our first action together.</i>

364
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,321
<i>The birth of something real big.</i>

365
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:02,881
<i>And I was a part of it.</i>

366
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:09,761
How do I know that what you're
telling me, is for real?

367
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:15,841
17-04-736212

368
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:18,401
What did you say?

369
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,361
Your insurance number.

370
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:22,001
Born in Friedrich

371
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:24,000
studies in Germany.

372
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:25,881
Graduated as the best of the year.

373
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:28,162
Investigator at the European
Cybercrime Center in Hague.

374
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,800
Two bank accounts: One at Densk Bank

375
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:32,121
other at Holland Direct Bank.

376
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:36,641
During the study period, you had a problem.

377
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:40,161
Since then you couldn't have kids anymore.

378
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:42,441
Because of an uterus disease.

379
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,241
Your colleagues consider you cold

380
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:49,761
I consider you lonely.

381
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:57,600
<i>We needed a place for hacking.</i>

382
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,281
<i>My grandma's house was the perfect place.</i>

383
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:02,200
This reminds me of the old times.

384
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,721
Having a computer crib or something.

385
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:07,961
1 million views!

386
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:12,521
We need a name!

387
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:16,361
We must become a brand!
We must become famous!

388
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,640
All what attention generates
is counterproductive.

389
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:20,760
We're staying off the radar.

390
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:21,681
Fuck the radar!

391
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:22,681
Brand is awesome!

392
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,081
Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!

393
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:25,761
Like MRX!

394
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:28,641
Are you all completely nuts?

395
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:32,481
<i>Max had an idea.</i>

396
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,041
<i>If Max had an idea, nothing could stop him</i>

397
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:56,241
I no longer do this shit with you!

398
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:58,202
Take the surprise from chocolate!

399
00:29:58,281 --> 00:29:59,200
Take it!

400
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,201
Sure! No problem!

401
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:01,560
I follow the polls!

402
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:02,561
Who is "for"?

403
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:09,961
We still need a name.

404
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,761
How about "CLAY"?

405
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,441
As in "Clowns laughing at you"

406
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:18,721
because it's all about fun
and because of the mask.

407
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,601
Nominated with 4 votes.

408
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:27,681
For CLAY.

409
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:46,641
<i>Clay's next move was a small
greeting to the financial world.</i>

410
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,040
We had taken a liking to this.

411
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,921
Our next target was a big pharma company.

412
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:11,841
<i>Max was right.</i>

413
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:14,041
<i>The bolder you were, the
more you could achieve.</i>

414
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,401
<i>We hacked everything we got our hands on.</i>

415
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,521
<i>The ritalin kept us awake.</i>

416
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:20,881
<i>We didn't take anything
and anyone seriously.</i>

417
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:55,800
<i>Who hides behind this mask?</i>

418
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:57,121
<i>Is it a criminal organization</i>

419
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:00,321
<i>or just a group of rebel teenagers?</i>

420
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,001
Hi!

421
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:25,041
What are you doing?

422
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:26,801
Me? Nope.

423
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:29,561
You?

424
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:35,521
I'm looking for the man of the rainbow.

425
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:38,201
<i>Marie? Are you coming?</i>

426
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:43,561
We must stop meeting in secret!

427
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:45,921
And also leave our covers!

428
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:54,481
You're such a fiasco!

429
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:56,521
You... for you it's easy!

430
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,521
You're... you're different!
People are listening to you!

431
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:01,601
You're cool!

432
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:05,441
Maybe you're right!

433
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:28,881
When life gives you lemons,
ask for salt and tequila.

434
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:36,361
<i>Max was marching on</i>

435
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,321
<i>but his mood could change in seconds.</i>

436
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:44,681
<i>For weeks he tried to get from
MRXa reaction about CLAY.</i>

437
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:47,801
<i>He wanted appreciation
from his biggest idol.</i>

438
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:00,961
We are fucking losers!

439
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,721
<i>But MRX didn't give a fuck about us.</i>

440
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:08,961
<i>Abroad there was another player.</i>

441
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:13,081
<i>Around this time she entered the game.</i>

442
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:20,041
<i>Now I call on Hanne Lindberg, lead
cybercrime investigator of Europol.</i>

443
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:26,761
<i>Yesterday night, was a cyberattack on
the European Central Bank of Frankfurt.</i>

444
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:30,441
<i>We found out that the
same hackers are involved</i>

445
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:35,001
<i>which are also behind the attacks
on the German Army's servers.</i>

446
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,281
<i>They call themselves "Fr13nds".</i>

447
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:42,561
Fr13nds is part of the Russian cyber mafia.

448
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:46,121
They hacked as in the past years
many international targets.

449
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:47,681
The group has 4 nicknames to locate

450
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:48,921
3 of them are:

451
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:53,160
The last one is still unknown.

452
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:55,561
The data they got was sold
on the so-called "darknet"

453
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,361
and consumed by the Russian cyber mafia.

454
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:01,160
According to our newest
investigations, at least one

455
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:02,680
of the Fr13nds members seems
to operate from Berlin.

456
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:05,081
Our commission joins the
Europol investigations.

457
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:11,241
Nobody knows the Fr13nds and their past
actions better than Hanne Lindberg.

458
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:14,440
Is it true that you're tracking
the Fr13nds for 3 years

459
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:15,441
without success?

460
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,841
Yes!

461
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,801
OK. Any other questions?

462
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:22,921
Good.

463
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:26,441
Hanne!

464
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:31,721
I just wanted to say...

465
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,441
Glad to see you!

466
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:38,161
I hope you don't have
any problems with this.

467
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:39,241
No!

468
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:44,521
No. I'm glad to work with you!

469
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:46,881
Good.

470
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:50,761
One more thing...

471
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:56,161
The fact that we were together,
no one must know it.

472
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:59,601
People are talking. Must
lose the information!

473
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,701
<i>While she was hunting
the Fr13nds, Max tried</i>

474
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:07,626
<i>to get rid of the
frustration caused by MRX.</i>

475
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:31,801
Wanna take a ride?

476
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:35,201
<i>Max and Stefan borrowed one of Paul's toys</i>

477
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:39,600
<i>and tampered the transmission line
of a radio's prize competition.</i>

478
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,240
<i>They interrupted all the lines but one</i>

479
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:43,441
<i>so that Max could be put through.</i>

480
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:45,361
Hello!

481
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:46,681
My name is Benjamin Engel.

482
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:49,641
The correct answer is B: Ottmar Hitzfeld.

483
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:56,841
Are you crazy?

484
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:59,040
What has this to do with CLAY?

485
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:01,441
What kind of fucking message
is behind stealing a Porsche?

486
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:03,201
It's not like that!

487
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,361
It's not like a shitty Renault!

488
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,680
Superheros need a superhero car!

489
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:09,681
Exactly!

490
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:12,121
Moreover it's not stolen, it's won!

491
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:14,841
Forget it!

492
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:48,161
Here!

493
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:20,601
Excuse me, girls!

494
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:23,201
We were a bit late!

495
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:46,921
These guys are like Windows: It
takes a while till they boot up.

496
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:52,521
Cheers!

497
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:53,601
You can be whoever you want!

498
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:55,721
Check this out!

499
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,521
Be open minded!

500
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:12,961
You achieved everything when you
completed your ultimate challenge.

501
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:18,481
So can Benjamin, for example, he has a
huge potential, but he doesn't use it!

502
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:24,241
He hides behind the others.
He doesn't open his mouth!

503
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:27,321
If someone must always pull you

504
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:29,561
then you'll never go far!

505
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:32,801
Most of the people can only follow rules!

506
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,401
It wasn't enough!

507
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,921
<i>Max was right. I had to
finally change something</i>

508
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:46,401
I passed the exam!

509
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:51,681
What are you up to now?

510
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:55,081
Do you know how I made it?

511
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,441
Nope.

512
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:02,241
I've intentionally answered
wrong the questions.

513
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:05,321
Why?

514
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:08,960
There are so many possibilities outside.

515
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,761
I had the feeling that is not carved
in stone that I pass the exam.

516
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:15,681
Like all the doors shut forever.

517
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:19,481
But now I've decided on a door.

518
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,401
Why are you driving a Porsche?

519
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:32,321
I'm the employee of the month.

520
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:39,561
Or maybe I'm also a superhero

521
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:41,201
and this is my superhero car.

522
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:44,721
Yeah... maybe.

523
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,801
<i>Come on! Believe in yourself!</i>

524
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:54,361
<i>Be like Max.</i>

525
00:43:54,921 --> 00:43:56,481
<i>Aim for the impossible!</i>

526
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:09,441
I'd better go out.

527
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:20,601
It fits to Porsche.

528
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:43,641
Oh look who's here!

529
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:45,161
The pizza bird!

530
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:53,481
Get your hands off Marie!

531
00:44:58,361 --> 00:44:59,681
<i>Nothing has changed.</i>

532
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:09,681
Everything's alright?

533
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,041
Don't ask.

534
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:15,761
MRX sent a message!

535
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:20,041
<i>MRX hasn't missed a single word about CLAY</i>

536
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:21,441
until this moment.

537
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:28,400
<i>In front of us we had the
confidential cybercrime</i>

538
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:30,681
<i>investigation document
they sent to Europol.</i>

539
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:36,281
<i>It was a marked paragraph about CLA Y.</i>

540
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:43,120
<i>The packet's purpose was only one:</i>

541
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:44,481
<i>He wanted make this clear to us.</i>

542
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,360
<i>CLAY in his eyes wasn't more</i>

543
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:47,361
<i>than whining babies.</i>

544
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:56,800
We'll finish the fucker!

545
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:58,321
Let's do an attack that tops all!

546
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:04,360
We could hack a big bank!

547
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,761
Yes! The money of a famous company!

548
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:07,881
Bullshit!

549
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:10,161
We need an attack on something real huge!

550
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:11,761
Something able to reach the Olympus!

551
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,641
The Federal Intelligence Service.

552
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:15,721
What?

553
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:16,961
BND!

554
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:20,881
The king class.

555
00:46:22,481 --> 00:46:24,201
The German Secret Service.

556
00:46:26,441 --> 00:46:27,561
Bullshit! It's unhackable!

557
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:28,681
No system is safe.

558
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:31,001
And aim for the impossible!

559
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:47,961
<i>The BND action must be the
most complex we ever did.</i>

560
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:47,961
Here you go, you pussy!

561
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,321
<i>With the right bait</i>

562
00:47:50,761 --> 00:47:52,281
<i>you can catch any fish.</i>

563
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:02,041
<i>Without knowing, Gerdigranted us access.</i>

564
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:13,321
<i>But from her system we still
couldn't access the main server.</i>

565
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:15,801
<i>Gerdi was the jackpot, though.</i>

566
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:18,841
<i>Gerdi was responsible for the card cloning</i>

567
00:48:18,921 --> 00:48:20,841
<i>and for distribution of
the entry-cards to BND.</i>

568
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:23,400
Accepted by password or address?

569
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,321
<i>It was the all time
biggest breaking cliché.</i>

570
00:48:26,161 --> 00:48:27,161
Idiots!

571
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:34,801
<i>Many tried to hack the BND before.</i>

572
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:38,481
<i>But you can't do this only
by hiding behind your desk.</i>

573
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:42,481
Ready?

574
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,481
Where's Benjamin?

575
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:01,001
No idea.

576
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:03,601
Where have you been?

577
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,161
<i>We really made it.</i>

578
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:15,321
<i>That was the Olympus.</i>

579
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:20,321
<i>We haven't just climbed it, we
also have put a flag on its peak.</i>

580
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:27,921
<i>As for BND, the employees will get the
next day the shock of their lives.</i>

581
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:29,321
<i>That was my night.</i>

582
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:30,881
Leave me alone!

583
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:32,081
Let us in!

584
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:34,841
Don't act like a kid!

585
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:35,921
And you like an asshole!

586
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,200
You're nothing without us!

587
00:53:38,201 --> 00:53:39,201
A nobody!

588
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:40,721
<i>It's enough.</i>

589
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:46,921
Nobody.

590
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:50,081
Nobody

591
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:07,840
<i>without the others knowing it.</i>

592
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:09,521
<i>I stole secret data from BND server.</i>

593
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:50,800
First he has manipulated the printers over
the communication protocol

594
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:53,521
then he bypassed the security firewall

595
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:55,281
and stole data.

596
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:57,641
Our unhackable system

597
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,241
has been hacked in 2 minutes 23.

598
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:04,441
You're saying this like you
were excited about it.

599
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:05,841
Whoever did this is a genius.

600
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:08,920
We should have had recordings.

601
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:11,241
They deleted all the video
files and left something.

602
00:55:20,441 --> 00:55:22,561
<i>But everything has a consequence.</i>

603
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:24,561
<i>Every single fly flap.</i>

604
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:29,001
That was found about his body.

605
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,081
He was found in the woods.

606
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:35,121
Moritz Lauer, better known as Krypton.

607
00:55:47,521 --> 00:55:48,521
Morning!

608
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:52,001
Get out!

609
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:56,561
Get lost!

610
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:58,640
What the fuck? You need us!

611
00:55:58,641 --> 00:55:59,480
What?

612
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,481
I need you?

613
00:56:00,681 --> 00:56:02,081
Or maybe you need me!

614
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:03,481
Do you know what?

615
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:06,281
You're nothing! You're nothing
more than a shitty impostor!

616
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:08,561
All you can do is using
people and manipulate them!

617
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:19,721
Stop! Stop!

618
00:56:23,281 --> 00:56:24,000
Be quiet!

619
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:25,001
Quiet!

620
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:30,641
<i>This morning was found the dead body of the
hacker which has the pseudonym "Krypton".</i>

621
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:35,721
<i>His dead and the</i> German Secret
Service hack of the last night</i>

622
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:41,321
confront the BND with something that might
be the biggest scandal of its history.

623
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:45,281
N <i>ear to the dead body, was
found the stolen data from B</i> ND.

624
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:48,321
<i>A secret employees list</i>

625
00:56:48,841 --> 00:56:51,481
<i>proving that</i> Krypton worked for the BND.</i>

626
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:56,641
<i>It seems that</i> Krypton belongs
to the hackers group Friends.</i>

627
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:01,681
<i>Financed by the</i> B N <i>D to collect
information about hackers.</i>

628
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:09,681
<i>At this time, the hackers group CL</i> A <i>Y
seems responsible for the BND breaking.</i>

629
00:57:12,321 --> 00:57:14,080
You were the only one in the server room!

630
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:15,081
What have you done there?

631
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:19,400
We said that we don't touch anything, take
anything and turn on only the printers!

632
00:57:19,401 --> 00:57:20,401
Did you leave any data?

633
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:26,761
I've found a hidden
partition on the BND server

634
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:29,441
I have... I've cracked the password

635
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:32,520
and then downloaded some
kind of employees list

636
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:33,521
I don't know...

637
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:35,041
I sent it to MR <i>X.</i>

638
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:36,121
Are you crazy?

639
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:37,961
I wanted to prove him!

640
00:57:38,481 --> 00:57:39,760
I wanted to prove you!

641
00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:40,761
You thought I'm a nobody!

642
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:48,240
<i>Sometimes we hold so tight a
photograph we got from someone.</i>

643
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:50,321
<i>It was like I couldn't
recognize myself anymore.</i>

644
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:54,161
<i>Everyone sees what they want.</i>

645
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:03,841
<i>Suddenly, it was crystal clear.</i>

646
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:06,441
<i>MRX has sold the stolen data
to the Russian cyber mafia.</i>

647
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,561
MRX belongs to the Fr13nds.

648
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:14,920
When he found out that Krypton worked
for the BND, he eliminated him!

649
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:17,321
Now everyone thinks that we did it!

650
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:19,441
It's only his fault!

651
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:30,441
Austrian product.

652
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:34,920
Krypton has been admitted to the
government agency and was eliminated.

653
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:36,801
What has this to do with CLAY?

654
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:38,401
I don't know.

655
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:45,001
We could fail.

656
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:49,001
I received a call from Hague.

657
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,801
They wanted me to make an evaluation

658
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,161
of you.

659
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:54,281
Your work

660
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:01,320
I didn't know that your chair isn't stable.

661
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:02,881
Why didn't you tell me?

662
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:24,321
Where are you going?

663
00:59:24,521 --> 00:59:27,281
To find some fun. This isn't fun anymore!

664
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,201
Krypton is dead, Max, dead!

665
00:59:29,321 --> 00:59:31,960
And we'll get fucking blamed
for all this scandal!

666
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:33,881
Benjamin could hand himself
over to the police

667
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,961
and tell them how he built
alone his shit CLAY!

668
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:37,721
Do you want sacrifice one of us?

669
00:59:37,801 --> 00:59:39,801
You always wanted to run away!

670
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,600
I don't fuckin' care what
you're doing, I'm out!

671
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:42,601
Stefan! Wait!

672
00:59:43,441 --> 00:59:44,841
This is all my fault!

673
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:46,641
I must find MRX!

674
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:49,601
And then what?

675
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:51,320
It's not about us! It's about MRX

676
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,160
the Fr13nds

677
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:53,041
they are the target!

678
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:54,401
Benjamin is right. Running
away doesn't solve this.

679
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:56,881
There are so many tracks left there.

680
00:59:57,321 --> 01:00:00,040
It's just a matter of
time till they catch us!

681
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,921
We deliver them MRX and the Fr13nds
and we'll become invisible again.

682
01:00:03,161 --> 01:00:04,161
Exactly.

683
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:07,001
When I said "we" I didn't mean "you" too!

684
01:00:30,361 --> 01:00:32,481
Oh my god! What happened to you?

685
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,041
I'm fine.

686
01:00:34,241 --> 01:00:35,361
What do you want?

687
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:41,001
Last night you suddenly
disappeared and...

688
01:00:41,081 --> 01:00:42,481
and I thought that...

689
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:44,441
You came here for Max.

690
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:45,881
Max? No!

691
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:49,760
It's better that you go now.

692
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:52,281
Are you building there a bomb or what?

693
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:54,521
Anything else?

694
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:58,161
What's wrong with you?

695
01:00:58,481 --> 01:01:00,041
You're completely weird.

696
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:01,441
Exactly.

697
01:01:02,081 --> 01:01:04,040
That's all you can see, right?

698
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,041
The freak weirdo.

699
01:01:05,441 --> 01:01:06,561
Do you know what?

700
01:01:06,881 --> 01:01:08,681
I wish I had never met you!

701
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:15,561
<i>We had to find MRX.</i>

702
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:17,721
<i>I was the decoy.</i>

703
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:24,081
<i>We were lately so paranoic that
we could use only public networks.</i>

704
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:41,841
Oh! Here are you!

705
01:01:42,961 --> 01:01:43,961
Come on fast!

706
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:49,041
He tried to contact MR <i>X.</i>

707
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:01,441
His IP address is spoofed

708
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:04,281
he uses 100 different servers in Europe.

709
01:02:05,281 --> 01:02:08,241
He's changing his location
at every 3 seconds!

710
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:09,321
I think I got something!

711
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:14,241
The server he uses more often
points to this IP address.

712
01:02:15,401 --> 01:02:16,401
In Berlin!

713
01:02:16,641 --> 01:02:19,361
Get as much information as you can, Katja.

714
01:02:20,961 --> 01:02:23,681
<i>He gave me access to his private channel.</i>

715
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:26,161
What are you waiting for?

716
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:19,641
We're running out of time!

717
01:03:19,721 --> 01:03:20,841
I almost have it.

718
01:03:43,401 --> 01:03:44,401
They're here!

719
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:46,721
Did you get it?

720
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:48,521
Let's get outta here!

721
01:03:49,481 --> 01:03:50,481
Now.

722
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:52,441
We'll meet downstairs!

723
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:15,761
Nothing! As if the earth
had swallowed him up!

724
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:41,761
I am suspended.

725
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:47,601
They're looking for
someone else from Hague!

726
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,041
I'm sorry.

727
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:17,401
What did MRX ask for?

728
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:21,921
He wanted us to send a
Trojan to the Europol system.

729
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:27,921
If someone has access to Europol,
can track investigations

730
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:29,241
and tamper.

731
01:06:30,201 --> 01:06:31,441
What was your plan?

732
01:06:32,241 --> 01:06:34,081
We wanted to know who is MRX.

733
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:37,161
His identity in exchange for our freedom.

734
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:40,000
We wanted to prove that
he's behind Krypton's death.

735
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:42,521
We wanted to disappear from the
1st position of the wanted list.

736
01:06:43,281 --> 01:06:45,841
We only wanted to be... invisible again.

737
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:48,121
<i>To get access to MRX's computer</i>

738
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:51,000
<i>we had to reach deeply
into our bag of tricks.</i>

739
01:06:51,001 --> 01:06:53,201
<i>Stefan called the application
"the pregnant horse".</i>

740
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:56,360
<i>It was a Trojan horse
inside of a Trojan horse.</i>

741
01:06:56,361 --> 01:07:00,081
<i>The second when MRX would log on to
the Europol server using our backdoor</i>

742
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:03,400
<i>we could be able to access his computer.</i>

743
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:04,601
<i>And MRX's mask would fall.</i>

744
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:09,041
<i>But before we had to
destroy all the evidence</i>

745
01:07:26,121 --> 01:07:27,601
I want to apologise...

746
01:07:29,881 --> 01:07:31,001
for the blue-eyed

747
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:33,681
like Marie.

748
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:42,321
You knew all the time what she means to me

749
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:44,241
and you didn't give a fuck.

750
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,521
What can I say? I'm an asshole.

751
01:07:52,921 --> 01:07:54,401
The statement is true.

752
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:05,041
I'm an impostor! I could
never do what you can

753
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,601
I'm just a fucking script kiddie

754
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:09,680
I can't do more than copy/paste!

755
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:11,281
I don't even know how to program!

756
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,081
I didn't know that.

757
01:08:19,441 --> 01:08:20,601
Do you like this?

758
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,041
Love birdies!

759
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:54,921
<i>We were on the way to Hague</i>

760
01:08:55,401 --> 01:08:56,401
<i>to Europol.</i>

761
01:08:56,641 --> 01:08:58,681
<i>We had to get in the lion's den</i>

762
01:08:59,121 --> 01:09:00,561
<i>but the road was long.</i>

763
01:09:02,921 --> 01:09:04,521
<i>We tried several methods.</i>

764
01:09:05,561 --> 01:09:06,561
<i>No success.</i>

765
01:09:07,921 --> 01:09:09,521
<i>Our old phishing methods.</i>

766
01:09:10,601 --> 01:09:13,801
<i>We even tried to get in
across the canalization.</i>

767
01:09:17,881 --> 01:09:19,401
It's the only entrance.

768
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:25,241
What are you doing there?

769
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:30,601
A fucking nail!

770
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,001
Take it out!

771
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:38,441
<i>We had to admit that it was
impossible to enter the Europol.</i>

772
01:09:53,281 --> 01:09:54,881
What are you looking at?

773
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:03,361
<i>It was my fault.</i>

774
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:15,921
<i>I've dragged us in this.</i>

775
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,001
<i>I also had to get us out.</i>

776
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:35,881
<i>Man is by default trustful and confiding.</i>

777
01:10:36,761 --> 01:10:38,041
<i>Social engineering.</i>

778
01:10:43,321 --> 01:10:45,241
<i>Come on! Believe in yourself!</i>

779
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:55,721
<i>With Paul's box I could access a network</i>

780
01:12:55,841 --> 01:13:01,161
<i>and then a second one, in
parallel, a so called "evil twin".</i>

781
01:13:06,321 --> 01:13:10,601
<i>If someone had logged in from one
of the offices in that network.</i>

782
01:13:10,841 --> 01:13:12,641
<i>I could access their laptop</i>

783
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:14,321
<i>and then the server.</i>

784
01:13:16,881 --> 01:13:20,001
<i>MRX gave us an access key
to a darknet channel</i>

785
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:22,841
<i>where we could find the instructions.</i>

786
01:13:24,761 --> 01:13:27,761
<i>I only had to give MRX
the manipulated Trojan.</i>

787
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:32,121
<i>As soon as he would log
in in the Europol server</i>

788
01:13:32,601 --> 01:13:33,881
<i>his mask would fall.</i>

789
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:50,241
<i>But MRX foiled our trick.</i>

790
01:15:39,921 --> 01:15:40,921
<i>MRX won the game</i>

791
01:15:43,441 --> 01:15:44,841
<i>and I lost everything.</i>

792
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:13,641
<i>Max, Paul, Stefan</i>

793
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:18,241
<i>they're all dead.</i>

794
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:29,321
I want to be Benjamin again

795
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:35,361
I want to be invisible again.

796
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:41,561
This is Anne! Call me
as soon as you wake up!

797
01:16:41,841 --> 01:16:43,921
You must come here immediately!

798
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:04,681
Finally no one else.

799
01:17:10,601 --> 01:17:11,601
You came...

800
01:17:13,081 --> 01:17:14,081
Yeah, I came.

801
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:23,721
Oscar said that someone hacked the
University's server some months ago

802
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:25,601
and stole the questions
for the Bachelor exam

803
01:17:26,281 --> 01:17:27,281
and got caught.

804
01:17:34,801 --> 01:17:35,801
You once said that

805
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:41,321
you must find out who you are

806
01:17:43,841 --> 01:17:47,241
and that there are a lot
of opportunities outside

807
01:17:47,441 --> 01:17:49,521
but you can be whoever you want

808
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:51,121
you can be anything.

809
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:53,401
Do you understand?

810
01:17:54,121 --> 01:17:55,721
I can be the federation!

811
01:17:56,121 --> 01:17:57,201
You're a weirdo!

812
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:23,041
Do you come with me?

813
01:18:23,521 --> 01:18:25,721
I already said that you're crazy!

814
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:29,001
Where?

815
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:30,400
Wherever you want.

816
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:31,401
Copenhagen?

817
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,401
You can go anywhere and
want to go to Copenhagen?

818
01:18:34,481 --> 01:18:35,481
Why not?

819
01:18:36,161 --> 01:18:37,161
Yeah...

820
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:38,801
Why not.

821
01:18:49,681 --> 01:18:51,761
What else do you know about me?

822
01:18:52,841 --> 01:18:54,921
Do you know that I'm suspended?

823
01:18:57,921 --> 01:19:00,001
You want to be invisible again!

824
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:02,881
But the Fr13nds know who you are!

825
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:05,281
You want a new identity

826
01:19:05,881 --> 01:19:10,761
you want in the witness protection program!
That's all you always wanted!

827
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:14,321
For this I give you MRX, the Fr13nds.

828
01:19:15,441 --> 01:19:16,721
It's not that easy!

829
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:19,281
The Federal Criminal Police
Office will be successful

830
01:19:20,281 --> 01:19:22,081
politics and media, pleased.

831
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:23,961
You are rehabilitated.

832
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:47,241
Let's say I agree.

833
01:19:50,561 --> 01:19:51,961
How will you get MRX?

834
01:19:55,961 --> 01:19:57,241
Using a magic trick.

835
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:01,200
There are holes in his story
as big as the Death Star!

836
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:02,201
He's nothing.

837
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:03,601
A no one!

838
01:20:04,281 --> 01:20:06,561
He played with fire and got burned

839
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:08,961
but he can lead us to MRX!

840
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:11,600
If we have him we will
also get the Fr13nds!

841
01:20:11,601 --> 01:20:12,601
You're suspended!

842
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:19,161
The promise of the witness
protection program must end.

843
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:21,841
I need you for this!

844
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:28,761
How should work this magic trick?

845
01:20:29,681 --> 01:20:31,921
We will attack MRX's weakest point

846
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:34,721
his pride!

847
01:22:46,121 --> 01:22:47,121
We got him!

848
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:50,921
What's his real name?

849
01:22:52,641 --> 01:22:53,641
19 years old

850
01:22:54,281 --> 01:22:55,281
from New York.

851
01:22:55,961 --> 01:22:57,961
You should be the last one too

852
01:22:58,361 --> 01:22:59,961
so that you're not alone.

853
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:01,881
That's from Superman!

854
01:23:04,281 --> 01:23:06,401
In a few hours you're a freeman!

855
01:23:07,561 --> 01:23:08,761
New name, new city.

856
01:23:29,401 --> 01:23:33,001
There are holes in his story
as big as the Death Star!

857
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:48,001
I'd like to ask you some questions.

858
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:55,521
Do you know this person?

859
01:24:56,361 --> 01:24:57,361
No.

860
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:01,321
He said you were in the same class.

861
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:05,121
The freak!

862
01:25:07,481 --> 01:25:08,681
Have you seen Benjamin lately?

863
01:25:09,641 --> 01:25:10,641
No.

864
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,041
Excuse me.

865
01:25:14,201 --> 01:25:15,680
What's this all about?

866
01:25:15,681 --> 01:25:18,240
Benjamin is under the BKA's attention.

867
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:21,521
He declared that in the
last months you met often.

868
01:25:21,641 --> 01:25:22,641
We did what?

869
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:26,281
He's completely crazy!

870
01:25:28,321 --> 01:25:30,601
I'd never like to meet such a guy!

871
01:25:37,521 --> 01:25:39,721
Thank you for having time for me!

872
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:40,881
It's about Engel.

873
01:25:41,401 --> 01:25:42,920
Or better said "your angel".

874
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:43,720
You know him?

875
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:44,721
Since he was young.

876
01:25:46,561 --> 01:25:48,001
I have curated his mother.

877
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:49,361
What can you tell me about him?

878
01:25:49,961 --> 01:25:51,281
He's uncommunicative

879
01:25:51,721 --> 01:25:52,721
outsider.

880
01:25:53,641 --> 01:25:55,241
No wonders in his story.

881
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:57,321
His mother took her own life

882
01:25:57,641 --> 01:26:00,721
Benjamin has grown up in
unclear circumstances.

883
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:03,481
His mother had an identity problem.

884
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:05,041
Schizophrenia?

885
01:26:05,481 --> 01:26:07,401
Multiple personality disorder.

886
01:26:07,881 --> 01:26:11,801
She had multiple personalities
thinking they're all herself.

887
01:26:12,321 --> 01:26:14,361
The medication kept her at bay.

888
01:26:14,761 --> 01:26:17,361
In the end she couldn't endure anymore.

889
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:18,801
Is it inheritable?

890
01:26:18,921 --> 01:26:19,921
Possible.

891
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,641
What is it caused by?

892
01:26:22,121 --> 01:26:25,841
It can be caused by a
predisposition to other substances.

893
01:26:26,201 --> 01:26:29,521
Some medicines can make the
symptoms even stronger.

894
01:26:30,321 --> 01:26:31,760
There are several triggers.

895
01:26:31,761 --> 01:26:32,761
Ritalin?

896
01:26:34,521 --> 01:26:36,081
Ritalin is one of them.

897
01:26:38,441 --> 01:26:40,041
But what it's all about?

898
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:43,601
Is everything alright with Benjamin?

899
01:27:05,561 --> 01:27:07,400
The laboratory results are here!

900
01:27:07,401 --> 01:27:08,401
Let me guess! The bullets
are from the 2nd World War!

901
01:27:09,401 --> 01:27:10,401
Yes.

902
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,281
How did you get this wound?

903
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:19,641
What did hurt you?

904
01:27:20,161 --> 01:27:22,081
Why were the car keys at you?

905
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:25,440
It is supposed that Stefan
has driven the car!

906
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:27,840
What did you tell me about Paul?
About his mother?

907
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:29,041
She died when he was young.

908
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:30,601
That's you!

909
01:27:32,921 --> 01:27:34,001
They're all you!

910
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:37,241
No. They're dead!

911
01:27:37,921 --> 01:27:40,481
There are no dead bodies! No evidence!

912
01:27:40,841 --> 01:27:42,641
In any damn hotel in Hague!

913
01:27:48,161 --> 01:27:50,161
What you saw in the hotel room

914
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,281
doesn't exist!

915
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:12,481
You made them up in your imagination!

916
01:28:15,161 --> 01:28:16,761
CLAY - that's you alone!

917
01:28:20,681 --> 01:28:21,681
You are Max.

918
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:26,161
What? Did you think that I live here?

919
01:28:26,441 --> 01:28:27,441
You are Stefan!

920
01:28:30,481 --> 01:28:31,481
You are Paul!

921
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:37,601
Every action, it was you!

922
01:28:38,281 --> 01:28:39,281
Alone!

923
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:41,360
I don't even know one half of the people!

924
01:28:41,361 --> 01:28:42,361
All shit suckers!

925
01:28:42,601 --> 01:28:43,601
We need a name!

926
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:45,881
We must become a brand!
We must become famous!

927
01:28:45,961 --> 01:28:47,921
All what attention generates
is counterproductive.

928
01:28:48,361 --> 01:28:49,721
We're staying off the radar!

929
01:28:49,801 --> 01:28:51,881
Nothing off the radar! Brand is awesome!

930
01:28:52,881 --> 01:28:54,761
Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!

931
01:28:56,681 --> 01:28:57,681
Like MRX!

932
01:28:57,921 --> 01:28:58,921
Fucking nail!

933
01:29:10,641 --> 01:29:11,961
I'm not like my mom!

934
01:29:23,001 --> 01:29:24,001
I know who I am.

935
01:29:28,721 --> 01:29:30,641
That means that our agreement

936
01:29:32,441 --> 01:29:35,841
disqualifies you for the
witness protection program.

937
01:29:36,801 --> 01:29:38,601
No! You said we have a deal

938
01:29:38,961 --> 01:29:39,961
a caution!

939
01:29:40,161 --> 01:29:42,281
I get the witness protection
program, that's what you said!

940
01:29:42,401 --> 01:29:43,401
I'm sorry!

941
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:45,201
They killed Krypton

942
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:48,081
I betrayed MRX. They'll find me!

943
01:29:48,201 --> 01:29:49,401
Do you understand?

944
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:51,800
We had a deal! I get the
witness protection program!

945
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:52,922
That's what you promised me!

946
01:29:54,081 --> 01:29:55,081
I'm sorry.

947
01:29:55,841 --> 01:29:56,841
You're sick!

948
01:29:57,401 --> 01:29:58,761
I'm not like my mom!

949
01:30:14,281 --> 01:30:15,281
I'm sorry!

950
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:24,281
The Fr13nds will kill me
like they killed Krypton!

951
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:28,001
I want witness protection program!

952
01:30:28,601 --> 01:30:29,681
You promised me!

953
01:30:43,881 --> 01:30:44,881
Congrats!

954
01:30:51,561 --> 01:30:54,600
The collaboration between the Europol and
BKA (Federal Criminal Police Office)

955
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:57,762
has been from the start a cornposite of
efficiency, professionality and certain.

956
01:30:58,081 --> 01:31:00,601
Responsible for this is Hanne Lindberg

957
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:04,121
an exceptional fighter
against the cyber mafia.

958
01:31:04,641 --> 01:31:07,161
The Internet is not a legal black hole

959
01:31:07,521 --> 01:31:09,321
its doors aren't invisible!

960
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:11,481
Anyone can be traced.

961
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:16,201
I asked them to bring you to the court.

962
01:31:44,961 --> 01:31:46,681
I'm sorry for hacking you!

963
01:31:48,841 --> 01:31:49,841
It wasn't fair.

964
01:32:12,281 --> 01:32:15,801
The witness protection program
is literally a program.

965
01:32:19,561 --> 01:32:20,761
You have 5 minutes.

966
01:32:31,441 --> 01:32:33,041
<i>What will you tell them?</i>

967
01:32:33,401 --> 01:32:35,961
<i>That you're on the way to the courthouse.</i>

968
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:37,041
<i>Won't you be fired again?</i>

969
01:32:38,641 --> 01:32:42,241
<i>They wanted MRX, the Fr13nds.
You're a nobody to them!</i>

970
01:32:43,801 --> 01:32:45,481
<i>You're invisible to them!</i>

971
01:32:47,721 --> 01:32:50,361
Promise me that you're done with hacking

972
01:32:51,561 --> 01:32:52,561
I promise!

973
01:32:56,081 --> 01:32:57,601
No magic tricks anymore.

974
01:33:04,241 --> 01:33:05,241
Wait!

975
01:33:06,441 --> 01:33:07,721
Just one more thing.

976
01:33:14,241 --> 01:33:16,041
How do you make this trick?

977
01:33:22,921 --> 01:33:26,001
If you know how's working,
it's less deceiving.

978
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:36,881
Everyone sees what they wanna see.

979
01:33:41,121 --> 01:33:42,121
Ta ke ca re!

980
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:25,641
She swallowed it hook, line and sinker.

981
01:35:26,441 --> 01:35:29,521
The all time greatest
social engineering trick.

982
01:35:30,081 --> 01:35:32,480
Not even the Europol knows now who you are.

983
01:35:32,481 --> 01:35:33,481
What name did you pick?

984
01:35:33,641 --> 01:35:34,641
No name.

985
01:35:41,481 --> 01:35:42,481
<i>O</i> K<i>. Who am I?</i>

986
01:35:43,841 --> 01:35:44,841
<i>I'm Benjamin.</i>

987
01:35:45,361 --> 01:35:46,361
<i>I'm a hacker.</i>

988
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:48,241
<i>And this is my story.</i>

989
01:35:52,921 --> 01:35:54,321
<i>Hacking is like magic.</i>

990
01:35:54,721 --> 01:35:57,401
<i>They're both about deceiving the others.</i>

991
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:03,161
Where have you been?

992
01:36:03,241 --> 01:36:04,241
They have my computer!

993
01:36:04,601 --> 01:36:05,801
They know who am I, we all
gotta get outta here!

994
01:36:06,281 --> 01:36:07,281
What happened?

995
01:36:07,282 --> 01:36:08,400
I was at Europol.

996
01:36:08,401 --> 01:36:10,081
How did you get in there?

997
01:36:10,361 --> 01:36:13,880
I pretended to be one of the students
from a group it doesn't fuckin' matter!

998
01:36:13,881 --> 01:36:14,881
The task.. was a failure! They got..
They have all my personal details!

999
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:17,600
Everything! Do you understand?

1000
01:36:17,601 --> 01:36:20,041
We gotta get outta here! Immediately!

1001
01:36:24,281 --> 01:36:26,561
Come on! What are you waiting for?

1002
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:28,041
You're one of us!

1003
01:36:29,441 --> 01:36:30,841
We don't forsake you!

1004
01:36:35,001 --> 01:36:36,001
Now what?

1005
01:36:46,121 --> 01:36:47,721
No system is unhackable.

1006
01:36:49,401 --> 01:36:52,364
Excluded from the witness
protection program

1007
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:54,826
are persons having
psychic diseases.

1008
01:36:56,921 --> 01:36:57,921
Once again.

1009
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:01,601
Give her very detailed information

1010
01:37:01,961 --> 01:37:04,441
this works only if you trust yourself.

1011
01:37:04,961 --> 01:37:07,361
And if she doesn't feel manipulated!

1012
01:37:10,961 --> 01:37:11,961
You can do it!

1013
01:37:14,441 --> 01:37:15,601
Only this is left.

1014
01:37:27,281 --> 01:37:28,281
Ready?

1015
01:37:35,721 --> 01:37:37,081
We're all invisible!

1016
01:37:38,881 --> 01:37:40,201
What if she checked?

1017
01:37:42,361 --> 01:37:43,361
Don't worry!

1018
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:45,681
She has checked.

1019
01:37:46,441 --> 01:37:48,201
But she has what she wants.

1020
01:37:51,201 --> 01:37:52,601
No more magic tricks.
